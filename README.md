# Game-of-ThreatHunting---HuntIT

This tool 'HuntIT' is basically used for converting all the raw logs (traffic) which we collect directly from server or device (Ex- Web server logs)
into labelled data set. Once, we have this dataset, we can use Machine learning algorithm to allow the model to learn based on the dataset
and then, we can use this model to identify any kind og new traffic as Normal or malicious. 

This also marks the use of Analytics in Cyber security similar to what most of the modern day security solutions do. This is the entire manual process of carying out the entire process
which any big cybersecurity solution perform.

It also semi-automated the threat hunting process.

Enjoy the Game of Threat Hunting !! HuntIT !!!
